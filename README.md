# rPi LoRa with Semtech xl1278

This project uses a Linux SBC like the Raspberry Pi. Actually I'm using the Libre Le Potato.
Please install gpiod and double-check your IO with
`gpioinfo | less`

You will need to modify the pinout depending on which board you have and how you wired it up. 

You can install the python dependencies with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
